# Code of Conduct

## Diversity and Inclusivity

## Expected Behaviour
Our expected behaviour includes:
- Using respectful and kind language.
- Giving each other time to present our ideas and repecting those ideas.
- Contributing equally to the repository.
- Doing our work to the best of our ability.
- Communicating with each other and responding to each other's messages within 48 hours.
- Asking each other for help if there is something we do not understand or if our workload is too much to handle.
- Recognizing that we may not know each other's full situation and being willing to provide support to one another.

## Unacceptable Behaviour
Unacceptable behaviour includes:
- Using disrespectful and inappropriate language.
- Slacking and not doing one's work without communication with the other group members.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour
The offender's individual performance assessment in the team work assessment will reflect any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Any extreme behaviour will be reported to the DSCI 310 teaching team before the team work assessment is due.

## Procedure for Reporting and Dealing with Unacceptable Behaviour
If someone is using disrespectful language, we will politely point out that their language is unacceptable and ask them to use more respectful language.

If someone is not doing their work without communicating with the other group members, we will talk to them to see what's going on, if they need help, and if we can make a plan to reach our goals/expectations by providing support or redistributing responsibilities.

If the unacceptable behaviour continues or escalates, we will report to and consult the DSCI 310 teaching team.
